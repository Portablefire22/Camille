# Camille

Camille aims to be an XMPP server that tries to implement enough of the standard to establish 
and maintain an active connection with a pre-existing, third-party, Client. As this server 
interfaces with an existing client, the hope is that the server will be forced to implement 
key features of that standard that would allow for the server to be a general purpose XMPP server.

I have absolutely 0 idea on how XMPP works other than it uses XML, and I have basically 0 
experience creating anything like this. It will be interesting to see if I can actually do this 
:)

## Name?

League of Legends reference. There is a character called Camille that has blades for legs, and 
this project is C# so like the C is Camille and the Sharp is her legs? Probably sounds like a 
stretch because it is, I picked the name whilst debating over picking between C++/Java.
